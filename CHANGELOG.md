## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- The package, `__version__` and the MCP server reported 0.1.0 while the
  v1.0.0 release and image said 1.0.0; all three now carry the release version.

### Changed
- Constitution is now a v1.18.0 manifest: only repo-specific facts remain;
  fleet and profile rules apply by reference.
- Constitution validation is pinned via `.github/workflows/constitution.yml`.
- Dependabot auto-merges GitHub Actions minor and patch updates.
